    title1:"Health and Safety at HannStar",
    subTitle1:`At HannStar, we are committed to reducing the risk of occupational injuries and strive
    for improvements and optimization alongside four major aspects: education and
    training, manpower allocation, equipment improvement and system improvement.
    We have invested more than ten million dollars in resources and systems and have
    checked and managed more than 16,000 safety switches. Not only this, but we
    have added seven dedicated work safety personnel, trained nearly 900 colleagues,
    formulated safety procurement standards and improved nearly 100 pieces of
    equipment. At the same time, in a bid to strengthen and improve the workplace and
    environment, we also created 101 inspection areas and enhanced operating processes.`,
    title2:"Prevention and Relief of Occupational Hazards",
    subTitle2:`In addition to entrusting an external institution to perform operating environmental sampling inspection, we also promote one-on-one guidance and conditioning services by
    professional occupational therapists to reduce and prevent musculoskeletal injuries, ensuring the health of employees. In order to prevent lung lesions of operators that may be
    caused by ITO target-grinding works, we have improved the exposure of the indium target. Aside from planning an independent space for operation, we require operators to wear
    positive pressure respiratory protection and provide special health examinations for indium in the blood of operators. In doing so, we are able to keep abreast of the exposure of
    employees while implementing graded health management. At present, the current indium detection values (≦ 3.0μg/L) in the blood of operators meet the regulatory requirements.
    Additionally, to protect external workers who deliver contracting engineering, we implement various safety management mechanisms and have established the “Contractor Safety,
    Health and Environmental Management Measures.” For special operations (including fire, hanging, confined space), we require the handling unit to conduct pre-operational checks
    alongside the personnel of the Work Safety Office and contractors. An operation may only start once relevant safety protection is met.`,

    LCD Factory and Touch Sensor Factory at the Tainan Science Park, as well as the
    manufacturing of TFT-LCD modules and touch panels in Nanjing Site. Furthermore, we
    have completed the verification of ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management
    system, covering health and safety management items for HannStar’s employees,
    contractors, and self-employed operators.`,

    graphics3SubTitle:`As the health and safety of all workers is our top priority, new employees are informed of the safety and life items in the operation process on the first day of training. Furthermore,
    new employees are required to sign the “Safety and Life Clause.” If a new employee is aware of a work condition which may cause harm or illness during the operational process, the
    worker may withdraw from his/her work in accordance with the “Safety and Life Clause.” Where the Clause is violated and causes an accident as a result, the worker’s supervisor will
    impose penalties in accordance with the Reward and Punishment Management Procedures.`,
